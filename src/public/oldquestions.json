We found that the network , specifically the BIGIP was functioning normally.  When all servers in the back end were taken down the LTM reported the issue to the GTM and the DNS resolved to the alternate datacenter as expected. The problem appears to be with the caching on the Tetris ( Source) servers. Once they were rebooted All things operated normally. We, Frank Lowe, Karthik Kesiraju and I, worked diligently to discover and test the issue. We provided configuration details , gathered from research from Java and Tomcat support sites, that would repair the current Issue.\n\nMy question is this: How can I give Credit to Frank and Karthik for a job well done as they are not assigned to our team?",
